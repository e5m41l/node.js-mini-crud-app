In this repo I apply the CRUD operation using node.js, express and Joi library to validate input

## API Endpoints
- POST /api/courses: Create a course
- GET /api/courses/: Get all courses
- GET /api/courses/{id}: Get course by ID
- PUT /api/courses/{id}: Update course
- DELETE /api/courses/{id}: Delete course
